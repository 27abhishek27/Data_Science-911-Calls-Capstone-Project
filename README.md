# 🚨 911 Calls Data Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  

This project analyzes real **911 emergency call data** to uncover **patterns, peak times, and emergency distributions**. By leveraging **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn**, it visualizes critical insights that can help **optimize emergency response strategies**.  

## 📊 Key Visualizations  

### 1️⃣ Calls by Reason  
- Categorizes **911 calls** into **EMS (Emergency Medical Services), Fire, and Traffic**.  
- Helps understand which type of emergency is most frequent.  
📍 `![Calls by Reason](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/911%20calls%20by%20reason.png)`

### 2️⃣ Cluster Map of Calls  
- A **heatmap representation** showing where **911 calls** are most frequent across different time frames.  
📍 `![Cluster Map](png/clustermap.png)`

### 3️⃣ Calls Per Month  
- Displays the **monthly trend of emergency calls** to identify peak periods.  
📍 `![Calls Per Month](png/calls_per_month.png)`

### 4️⃣ Countplot Chart  
- A **countplot** representing the frequency of **911 calls** based on different categories.  
📍 `![Countplot Chart](png/countplot_chart.png)`

### 5️⃣ EMS Calls Distribution  
- Focuses on **Emergency Medical Service (EMS) calls**.  
- Useful for medical teams to understand the volume of emergency health-related calls.

### 6️⃣ Fire Calls Distribution  
- Visualizes the number of **fire-related emergency calls** over time.  
📍 `![Fire Calls](png/fire_chart.png)`

### 7️⃣ Grouped Calls by Date  
- Aggregates **911 calls per day**, showing trends over time.  
📍 `![Grouped Calls](png/groupby_date_column.png)`

### 8️⃣ Heatmap for 911 Calls  
- A **heatmap** visualizing call frequency across **hours and days of the week**.  
- Helps in **identifying peak emergency hours**.  
📍 `![Heatmap](png/heatmap_for_911_calls.png)`

### 9️⃣ Heatmap for Month & Call Type  
- Shows the distribution of **911 calls** based on the month and type of emergency.  
📍 `![Heatmap for Month & Type](png/heatmap_for_month_and_column.png)`

### 🔟 Linear Regression Plot (LMPlot)  
- Analyzes the **relationship between months and call volume** using regression analysis.  
📍 `![LMPlot](png/lmplot_chart.png)`

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Traffic Calls Over Time  
- Tracks **fluctuations in traffic-related emergency calls** over different time periods.  
📍 `![Traffic Calls](png/traffic_chart.png)`

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Cluster Map for Month & Call Type  
- Another **clustering heatmap** that groups calls based on the **month and emergency type**.  
📍 `![Cluster Map - Month & Type](png/clustermap_for_month_and_column.png)`

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data analysis  
- **Data Visualization** for actionable insights  

## 🔥 Key Takeaways  

✔ **Traffic-related calls spike** in certain months, likely due to weather or major events.  
✔ **EMS calls dominate** the dataset, emphasizing the need for **efficient medical response systems**.  
✔ **Heatmaps reveal patterns** in emergency calls, aiding in better **resource planning**.  

## 🚀 Why This Matters  

Understanding **911 call patterns** helps emergency services **optimize response times, allocate resources efficiently, and improve public safety**.
