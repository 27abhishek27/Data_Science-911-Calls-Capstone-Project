# 911 Calls Data Analysis Project

## üìå Overview

This project analyzes **911 emergency call data** to uncover trends and insights. Using Python and various data visualization techniques, we explore emergency call distributions, seasonal patterns, and reasons behind the calls.

## üìä Visualizations

Below are some key insights from the dataset:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Calls by Reason
![Calls by Reason](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/911%20calls%20by%20reason.png)



- Categorizes emergency calls into **EMS, Fire, and Traffic**.
- Helps in understanding the most frequent type of emergency.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster Map of Calls



- A heatmap representation showing the density of 911 calls across different time frames.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Calls Per Month



- Displays the monthly trend in emergency calls.
- Useful in identifying peak periods of emergency situations.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Countplot Chart



- A count plot showing the frequency of emergency calls based on different criteria.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ EMS Calls Distribution



- Focuses on emergency medical service calls.
- Useful for medical emergency response teams.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Fire Calls Distribution



- Visualizes the distribution of fire-related emergency calls.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Heatmap for 911 Calls



- Displays call volume across different hours and days.
- Helps in optimizing emergency response schedules.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Traffic Calls Over Time



- Shows fluctuations in traffic-related emergency calls over time.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for creating insightful charts

## üî• Key Insights

- **Traffic-related calls** show significant spikes during specific months.
- **EMS calls** are the most frequent type of emergency.
- **Seasonal trends** can be observed in call volumes.
- **Heatmaps & cluster maps** help in identifying patterns in emergency responses.

## üìå Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of 911 call data, helping emergency services optimize their response times and resource allocation. Data visualizations make it easier to interpret trends and patterns in emergency calls.
