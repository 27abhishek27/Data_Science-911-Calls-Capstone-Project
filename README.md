# 🚨 911 Calls Data Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  

This project analyzes real **911 emergency call data** to uncover **patterns, peak times, and emergency distributions**. By leveraging **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn**, it visualizes critical insights that can help **optimize emergency response strategies**.  

## 📊 Key Visualizations  

### 1️⃣ Calls by Reason  
- Categorizes **911 calls** into **EMS (Emergency Medical Services), Fire, and Traffic**.  
- Helps understand which type of emergency is most frequent.

### 2️⃣ Countplot Chart  
- A **countplot** representing the frequency of **911 calls** based on different categories.

### 3️⃣ Calls Per Month  
- Displays the **monthly trend of emergency calls** to identify peak periods.

### 5️⃣ Groupby Calls by Date  
- Aggregates **911 calls per day**, showing trends over time.  
📍 ![Grouped Calls](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/groupby%20date%20column.png)

### 6️⃣ Traffic Calls Over Time  
- Tracks **fluctuations in traffic-related emergency calls** over different time periods.  
📍 ![Traffic Calls](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/Traffic%20chart.png)

### 7️⃣ Fire Calls Distribution  
- Visualizes the number of **fire-related emergency calls** over time.  
📍 ![Fire Calls](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/Fire%20chart.png)

### 8️⃣ EMS Calls Distribution  
- Focuses on **Emergency Medical Service (EMS) calls**.  
- Useful for medical teams to understand the volume of emergency health-related calls.

### 9️⃣ Heatmap for 911 Calls  
- A **heatmap** visualizing call frequency across **hours and days of the week**.  
- Helps in **identifying peak emergency hours**.  
📍 ![Heatmap](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/Heatmap%20for%20911%20calls.png)

### 🔟 Cluster Map of Calls  
- A **heatmap representation** showing where **911 calls** are most frequent across different time frames.  
📍 ![Cluster Map](https://github.com/27abhishek27/Data_Science-911-Calls-Capstone-Project/blob/main/911%20calls%20projects%20png/Clustermap%20for%20911%20calls.png)


### 1️⃣1️⃣ Heatmap for Month & Call Type  
- Shows the distribution of **911 calls** based on the month and type of emergency.
